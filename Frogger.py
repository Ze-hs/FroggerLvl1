Description: This game is a copy of the original 1981 arcade game called Frogger. The
objective of the game is to guide the frog from the bottom of the screen to the top.
Along the way, there will be many obstacles suchs as the vehicles, river, logs and 
turtles. The player can control the frog using the "WASD" keys and each time the frog 
reaches his goal, some extra time will be alloted
